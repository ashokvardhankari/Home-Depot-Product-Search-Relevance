# Home-Depot-Product-Search-Relevance
Predicting the relevance of search results to the search terms on homedepot.com. 

This is a term project in my class OR 568 - Applied Predictive Analytics. I developed this project in Spring 2016.

To review my findings please check the presentation titled OR568_Final_HomeDepot.pptx. Do not refrain to shoot back for any questions/ concerns.
